# PAM configuration
#
# This file is now delivered with no entries.  The preferred mechanism
# for PAM configuration is now using per-service files in /etc/pam.d.
# Any modifications to this file will be preserved on system update and
# will be referenced before the per-service files in /etc/pam.d.
#
# The libpam(3LIB) library searches for PAM entries in the following order:
#
#       /etc/pam.conf for <service> entries
#       /etc/pam.d/<service>
#       /etc/pam.conf for "other" entries
#       /etc/pam.d/other
#
# See pam.conf(4) for more details.
#
# Unless explicitly defined here or in /etc/pam.d/<service>, all services
# use the modules defined with the service name of "other".
#
# Modules are defined with relative pathnames, i.e., they are
# relative to /usr/lib/security/$ISA. Absolute path names, as
# present in this file in previous releases are still acceptable.
