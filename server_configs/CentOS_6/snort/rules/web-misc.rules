#----------------
# WEB-MISC RULES
#----------------





# The following signatures are for non-standard ports.  When ports lists work,
# then these will be converted to use HTTP_PORTS & HTTP_SERVERS

# uricontent would be nice, but we can't be sure we are running http decoding
# on 2301.  oh for rna integration...


# when we get real ports list, we will merge these sigs.  so for now, keep the
# message the same.







# NOTES: this signature looks for access to common webalizer output directories.
# Webalizer is a http server log reporting program.  By allowing anyone on the
# internet to view the web access logs, attackers can gain information about
# your customers that probably should not be made public.  webalizer had cross
# site scripting bugs prior to version 2.01-09.


# NOTES: this signature looks for someone accessing the directory webcart-lite.
# webcart-lite allows users to access world readable plain text customer
# information databases.  To correct this issue, users should make the
# data directories and databases not world readable, move the files outside of
# WEBROOT if possible, and verify that a compromise of customer information has
# not occured.
# SIMILAR RULES: sid:1125


# NOTES: this signature looks for someone accessing the web application
# "webfind.exe".  This application has a buffer overflow in the keywords
# argument.  An attacker can use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary
# code on the web server.

# NOTES: this signature looks for someone accessing the file "active.log" via
# a web server.  By allowing anyone on the internet to view the web access
# logs, attackers can gain information about your customers that probably
# should not be made public.
#
# This logfile is made available from the WebActive webserver.  This webserver
# is no longer maintained and should be replaced with an actively maintained
# webserver.  If converting to another webserver is not possible, remove read
# access to this file.



# NOTES: this signature looks for someone accessing the file "robots.txt" via
# web server.  This file is used to make web spider agents (including search
# engines) more efficient.  robots.txt is often used to inform a web spider
# which directories that the spider should ignore because the content may be
# dynamic or restricted.  An attacker can use this information to gain insite
# into directories that may have been deemed sensitive.
#
# Verify that the robots.txt does not include any sensitive information.






# uricontent would be nice, but we can't be sure we are running http decoding
# on 8888.  oh for rna integration...


# YES, the contents are logically backwards as to how the contents are seen on
# the wire.  snort picks up the first of the longest pattern.  login=0 happens
# MUCH less than Cookie.  so we do this for speed.

















# one of these days, we will have port lists...
