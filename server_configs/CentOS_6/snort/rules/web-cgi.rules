# WEB-CGI RULES
#---------------

# testcgi is *one* of many scripts to look for.  this *ALSO* triggers on testcgi.exe.
# do we really need two of these?

# NOTES: this signature looks for someone accessing the web application
# "way-board.cgi".  This application allows attackers to view arbitrary
# files that are readable with the privilages of the web server.

# when we get por lists... merge this with 2387...
# the prevous rule looks for the attack, but we still want to catch the
# scanners.  if we had port lists, this rule would be HTTP_PORTS and 3000
